## 🚀 What Is This?

A **cross-platform music downloader and library manager** that turns Soulseek into your personal Spotify. Import playlists, download tracks, organize your library, and play music—all with a beautiful, responsive UI.

**Platform Status:**
- 🚧 **Windows 10/11**: In active development - core features working (import, download, library, player)
- 🔮 **macOS/Linux**: Built on cross-platform components (Avalonia UI), not yet tested

**Current Goal**: Stable, feature-complete Windows version  
**End Goal**: True multi-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**But here's the twist**: This entire project is built by a **non-developer using AI** (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT). Every feature, every bug fix, every architectural decision—all vibed into existence through AI pair programming.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

### Phase 4: Quality & Polish (Planned)
- Error handling & user-friendly messages
- Performance optimization
- Unit tests & documentation

### Phase 5: Self-Healing Library (The Big One!)
- **🧬 Acoustic Fingerprinting**: Detect duplicates by audio DNA, not filename
- **⬆️ Auto-Upgrade**: "You have a 128kbps MP3. Replace with FLAC?"
- **🔧 Broken Link Repair**: Moved files? App finds them automatically
- **🎭 Fake Quality Detection**: Detect upsampled 320kbps files
- **📁 USB/Folder Import**: Import existing libraries with quality analysis
- **🏥 Library Health Dashboard**: View duplicates, low-quality tracks, corrupt files

**Inspired by**: `audio-duplicates` (C++ performance) + `rekordbox-library-fixer` (TypeScript intelligence)

### Platform Roadmap
- ✅ **Phase 0**: Cross-platform foundation (Avalonia UI migration complete)
- 🚧 **Current**: Windows 10/11 in active development - core features functional
- 🔮 **Next**: Complete Windows feature set and stability
- 🔮 **Future**: macOS testing and Linux support

**Strategy**: Build on cross-platform components (Avalonia, .NET 8.0) from day one, ensuring Windows stability first, then expand to macOS/Linux with minimal code changes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Windows 10/11** (primary platform - in active development)
- .NET 8.0 SDK ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Soulseek account (free at [slsknet.org](https://www.slsknet.org))

> **Note**: This is an **active development project**. Core features work (import, download, library, player), but expect bugs and incomplete features. Built with Avalonia (cross-platform framework) for future macOS/Linux support.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MeshDigital/QMUSICSLSK.git
cd QMUSICSLSK

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the application
dotnet build

# Run it!
dotnet run
```

### Spotify API Setup (Required for Playlist Import)

To import playlists from Spotify, you need to create a Spotify Developer account and obtain API credentials:

#### Step 1: Create Spotify Developer Account
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account (or create one)
3. Accept the Terms of Service

#### Step 2: Create an App
1. Click **"Create an App"**
2. Fill in the details:
   - **App Name**: `QMUSICSLSK` (or any name you prefer)
   - **App Description**: `Music downloader for personal use`
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8888/callback` (important!)
3. Check the agreement boxes
4. Click **"Create"**

#### Step 3: Get Your Credentials
1. On your app's dashboard, click **"Settings"**
2. Copy your **Client ID**
3. Click **"View client secret"** and copy your **Client Secret**

#### Step 4: Configure QMUSICSLSK
1. Open the app and go to **Settings**
2. Navigate to the **Spotify** section
3. Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Click **Save**

> **Note**: Your credentials are stored securely using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI). They never leave your computer.

**Detailed Guide**: [How to Generate Spotify API Key](https://codewolfy.com/how-to-generate-spotify-api-key/)

### First-Time Setup

1. **Sign in** with your Soulseek credentials (stored securely)
2. **Configure Spotify API** (see above) for playlist import
3. **Set download directory** in Settings
4. **Import music** from Spotify, CSV, or paste a tracklist
5. **Start downloading** and enjoy!

---

## 🎵 How It Works
1. **Import** → Paste a Spotify playlist URL or tracklist from YouTube
2. **Preview** → Review imported tracks, adjust search queries
3. **Download** → Tracks are queued and downloaded automatically
4. **Organize** → Drag tracks between playlists in Library view
5. **Play** → Built-in player with shuffle, repeat, and queue management

### Smart Features
- **Timestamp Removal**: Paste `[00:00] Artist - Title` → Auto-cleans to `Artist - Title`
- **Duplicate Detection**: Won't download the same track twice
- **Bitrate Filtering**: Only download 320kbps or FLAC
- **Auto-Retry**: Failed downloads retry automatically

## 🤖 The AI Development Story

### "I'm Not a Real Developer"

This project is a **proof of concept** that you don't need to be a "real developer" to build complex software. Every line of code, every architectural decision, every bug fix—**all created through AI pair programming**.

**Tools Used:**
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - Primary coding assistant
- **Gemini** (Google) - Architecture planning
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) - Problem-solving

**Development Process:**
1. Describe feature in plain English
2. AI generates implementation plan
3. Review, iterate, refine
4. AI writes the code
5. Test, debug, repeat

**Result**: A **cross-platform music app** with features rivaling commercial software, built by someone who "vibes their way through coding."

### Why This Matters

This project demonstrates:
- **AI democratizes software development** - You don't need a CS degree
- **Non-developers can build real products** - Just need vision and persistence
- **AI pair programming works** - When you know what you want, AI helps you build it

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Audio Playback Issues
- **Problem**: "Player Initialization Failed"
- **Solution**: Ensure `libvlc` folder exists in output directory
- **Check**: Console output for LibVLC errors

### Import Not Working
- **Problem**: Spotify import fails
- **Solution**: Check Spotify API credentials in Settings
- **Alternative**: Use CSV import or paste tracklist

### UI Not Responsive
- **Problem**: Window too small
- **Solution**: Minimum window size is 360x500px
- **Note**: Navigation auto-collapses below 800px width

## 🔥 The Bottom Line

**This is what happens when a non-developer gets access to AI and refuses to give up.**

From "I don't know how to code" to "I'm building a cross-platform music app with acoustic fingerprinting"—all through the power of AI pair programming and sheer determination.

**If I can do it, you can too.** 🚀
