## ✅ Recently Completed (December 2024)

### Phase 2A: The Ironclad Recovery System - COMPLETE
**Impact**: Guaranteed zero data loss during crashes/power failures.
- **Crash Recovery Journal**: Transactional logging (SQLite WAL) for all destructive operations.
- **Atomic Tag Writes**: ACID-compliant metadata updates (`SafeWriteService`).
- **Resilient Downloads**: Thread-safe heartbeat monitoring with stall detection.
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing on startup (checks journal, resumes operations, notifies user).
- **Performance**: <1% CPU overhead, <500ms startup delay.

### Phase 1B: Database Optimization - COMPLETE
**Impact**: 50-100x faster query performance.
- **WAL Mode**: Write-Ahead Logging for high concurrency.
- **Index Optimization**: Added critical covering indexes for library queries.
- **Connection Pooling**: Dedicated connection for high-frequency journal writes.

### Phase 8: Architectural Foundations - COMPLETE
**Impact**: Infrastructure for future sonic integrity features.
- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: Non-blocking batch analysis architecture.
- **Dependency Validation**: Smart FFmpeg detection with graceful degradation.
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Automated database vacuuming and backup cleanup.

### Phase 0-1: Core Features - COMPLETE
- **Intelligent Ranking**: "The Brain" scoring system (Bitrate > BPM > Availability).
- **Spotify Integration**: PKCE Auth, Playlist import, Metadata enrichment.
- **Modern UI**: Dark-themed Avalonia interface with "Bento Grid" layout.
- **P2P Engine**: Robust Soulseek client implementation.

## Phase 3A: Atomic Resumability & UI Transparency - COMPLETE ✅
- **Impact**: No redownloading files after a crash; "Value Gap" bridged.
- **Atomic Downloads**: Full `.part` file workflow integrated with Recovery Journal.
- **Health Dashboard**: Backend recovery status visible on Home Screen.
- **Schema Expansion**: "Dual-Truth" audio features (Spotify vs Manual) added to TrackEntity.

## Phase 3B: Download Health Monitor - COMPLETE ✅
**Phase Goal**: Automated self-healing for network instability.
- **Stall Detection**: Adaptive timeout logic (60s standard, 120s for >90% progress)
- **Auto-Retry**: Automatic peer switching for stalled transfers
- **Peer Blacklisting**: Temporary blacklist for problematic peers
- **Dual-Truth Schema**: IntegrityLevel enum (Pending → Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- **Clear Dead-Letters**: UI feature for manual recovery

## Phase 4: Rekordbox Integration - COMPLETE ✅
**Phase Goal**: Professional DJ export functionality.
- **RekordboxService**: Streaming XML generation using XmlWriter
- **KeyConverter**: Musical key normalization (Standard → Camelot → OpenKey)
- **XmlSanitizer**: Metadata safety for Rekordbox compatibility
- **Playlist Export**: Context menu on playlist items
- **Monthly Drop**: Tools menu feature for recent tracks (last 30 days)
- **SaveFileDialog**: Integrated using Avalonia StorageProvider

## 🎯 Archived Priority: UI Placeholder Refactor (Completed Phase 3A)

With the backend hardened, we must align the frontend reality with user expectations.

### 1. Health Dashboard Integration
- **Goal**: Visualize the `CrashRecoveryJournal` status in the UI.
- **Implementation**:
    - Update `HomeViewModel` to query `DeadLetter` status.
    - Active "System Health" widget on Dashboard (Green/Orange/Red).
    - "Review Manual Fixes" action for dead-lettered files.

### 2. UI Transparency Audit
- **Goal**: Eliminate "dead clicks".
- **Implementation**:
    - Disable buttons for `Rekordbox Export` and `Spectral Analysis`.
    - Add "Coming v1.1" tooltips.
    - Connect `TrackInspector` spectral fields to actual data sources (or hide if empty).

## 🔮 Future Phases

### Month 2: UI Transparency & Speed (January 2026)

#### 1. UI Refactor: "The Transparency Phase" (Highest Priority)
- **Goal**: Connect placeholder UI elements to real logic or clearly mark as "Coming Soon".
- **Features**:
    - **Health Dashboard**: Live status of Crash Journal (DeadLetters) & API Health.
    - **Logic Connection**: Hook up "Spectral Analysis" and "Export" buttons.
    - **Disabled States**: Prevent "dead clicks" on unimplemented features.

#### 2. UI Virtualization (Critical)
- **Goal**: Support libraries with 50,000+ tracks.
- **Tech**: VirtualizingStackPanel, lazy-loading viewmodels.
- **Metric**: 60 FPS scrolling at 10k items.

#### 1. Upgrade Scout
- **Goal**: Automatically find better versions of existing tracks.
- **Logic**: If Library has 128kbps MP3 → Search P2P for FLAC matching duration/metadata → Background Download → Atomic Swap.

#### 2. Sonic Integrity (Phase 8 Implementation)
- **Goal**: Verify true audio quality.
- **Tech**: FFmpeg spectral analysis to detect "transcoded" fake lossless files.

### Phase 9: Hardware Export
- **Goal**: Sync to DJ hardware.
- **Target**: Rekordbox XML export, FAT32 USB sync for Denon/Pioneer.

## 📊 Performance Targets vs Reality

| Metric | Target | Current Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Startup Time** | < 2s | **~1.5s** (Excellent) |
| **Crash Recovery** | 100% | **100%** (Verified Phase 2A) |
| **UI Responsiveness** | 60 FPS | **30 FPS** (Needs Virtualization) |
| **Search Speed** | < 5s | **~2-4s** (Good) |
| **Memory Usage** | < 500MB | **~300-600MB** (Variable) |

## 🐛 Known Issues (Backlog)

### High Priority
- **UI Scalability**: Large playlists cause UI stuttering (Phase 6C TreeDataGrid required).
- **N+1 Queries**: Some UI views trigger redundant database fetches.
- **Soft Deletes**: Deleting projects is currently destructive (needs Audit Trail).

### Medium Priority
- **Duplicate Detection**: Batch imports sometimes miss duplicates within the same batch.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Positioning issues on high-DPI displays.
