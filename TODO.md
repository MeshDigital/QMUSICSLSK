## 🎯 ORBIT v1.0: 8-Week Stabilization Focus (STRATEGIC PRIORITY)

**Source**: ORBIT v1.0 Complete Development Strategy  
**Decision**: **PAUSE NEW FEATURES for 8 weeks** to focus on reliability and speed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Month 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Operational Resilience - Fix download reliability, prevent data loss  
> **Month 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Speed & UX - Optimize database, UI virtualization, perceived performance

**Rationale**: Early adopters (DJ and audiophile communities) must not encounter a buggy experience that could damage project reputation. Build trust through reliability before adding features.

---

## Phase 0: Critical Operational Resilience (Weeks 1-4) 🔴⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY

### 0.1 Crash Recovery Journal (8 hours) - NEW ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Power loss or crashes during downloads cause orphaned files, lost state, and duplicate downloads.  
**Solution**: Lightweight transaction log that enables automatic recovery on startup.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `Services/CrashRecoveryService.cs`
- [ ] Add `CrashRecoveryJournal` SQLite table or JSON file
- [ ] Log active downloads with checkpoint data (bytes written, .part file paths, pending operations)
- [ ] Implement startup recovery logic:
  - Detect orphaned `.part` files
  - Resume interrupted downloads from last checkpoint
  - Rollback incomplete metadata writes
  - Clean up corrupted state
- [ ] Integrate with `DownloadManager` to write checkpoints every 5 seconds during active downloads
- [ ] Add `App.axaml.cs` startup hook to call `CrashRecoveryService.RecoverAsync()`

**Journal Schema**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "active_downloads": [
    {
      "track_id": "xyz",
      "state": "downloading",
      "bytes_written": 2457600,
      "part_file": "C:\\temp\\track.mp3.part",
      "last_checkpoint": "2025-12-24T00:10:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pending_metadata_writes": [...]
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents 100% of data loss from crashes. Professional-grade resilience.

---

### 0.2 SafeWrite Wrapper (4 hours) - NEW ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Direct file writes can corrupt files during power loss or app crashes.  
**Solution**: Reusable utility that ALL file-writing services use for atomic operations.

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `Utils/SafeWrite.cs` with atomic write pattern:
  ```csharp
  public static class SafeWrite
  {
      public static async Task<bool> WriteAtomicAsync(
          string finalPath, 
          Func<string, Task> writeAction,
          Func<string, Task<bool>>? verifyAction = null)
      {
          var tempPath = $"{finalPath}.part";
          // 1. Write to temp file
          // 2. Verify (optional)
          // 3. Atomic rename
      }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Refactor `DownloadManager` to use `SafeWrite.WriteAtomicAsync()`
- [ ] Refactor `MetadataTaggerService` to use SafeWrite for tag writes
- [ ] Refactor `DatabaseService.BackupAsync()` to use SafeWrite
- [ ] Refactor `ArtworkCacheService` to use SafeWrite for image downloads

**Impact**: Prevents file corruption even during power loss. Used by 4+ critical services.

- [ ] **Intelligent Download Hub (Bento Refactor)**:
  - [ ] Implement `DownloadAnalyticsService` for Global ETA/Speed windowing.
  - [ ] Refactor `DownloadsPage.axaml` with Bento Grid header (Speed, ETA, Storage, Health).
  - [ ] Integrate micro-thumbnails (64px) into `DownloadItemViewModel`.
  - [ ] Add Disk-I/O bottleneck detection warnings.
- [ ] **Real-time Deduplication Sync**: Ensure `PlaylistTrack` and `LibraryEntry` states stay in sync immediately upon download failure/success.
- [ ] **Library Resilience**: Implement automated daily backups of `%appdata%/SLSKDONET/library.db`.
- [ ] **Batch Duplicate Fix**: Update `DownloadManager.QueueProject` to check against `addedInBatch` set during hash check loop.
- [ ] **UI Thread Safety**: Wrap `PlaylistTrackViewModel` property updates (via event bus) in `Dispatcher.UIThread.Post`.
- [ ] **Coordinate Precision**: Refactor `LibraryPage.axaml.cs` drag-drop to use `VisualRoot` / `PointToClient` for transformations.
- [ ] **Selection Robustness**: Replace `Task.Delay` in `LibraryViewModel` with a reactive "Wait until Project exists in collection" logic.
- [ ] **Source of Truth Sync**: Update `TrackListViewModel` to cross-reference `DownloadManager` for active tracks not yet in global index.

### 🎯 Metadata Gravity Well 2.0 - Refinements (SpotiSharp Integration)
**Source**: Deep dive analysis comparing ORBIT implementation with SpotiSharp reference architecture

  - Handle `open.spotify.com/track/...` mobile share links
  - Handle `spotify:track:...` URI strings  
  - Generic "Intake" flexibility for user input
- [ ] **Native Batch Enrichment**: Refactor `SpotifyMetadataService.cs` to use native library for ISRC.
  - Use `client.Tracks.GetSeveral(new TracksRequest(ids))` to capture ISRC field
  - Already using `client.Tracks.GetSeveralAudioFeatures()` for BPM/Key ✅
- [ ] **Smart Duration Gating**: Implement `SearchResultMatcher.cs` fuzzy duration logic.
  - If Spotify says 210s, create "Success Range" of 207-213s
  - Score 1.0 for in-range, 0.0 for outliers (e.g., 8min Extended Mix)
  - Prevents false matches on remixes/radio edits

#### Phase 3: File Integrity & Normalization (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Filename Normalization Service**: Create `Utils/FilenameNormalizer.cs`.
  - Strip illegal OS characters: `\ / : * ? " < > |`
  - Remove redundant "feat." tags from Title if already in Artist field
  - Implement `Cleanup()` method for artist names (SpotiSharp pattern)
- [ ] **FFmpeg Progress Feedback**: Enhance `SonicIntegrityService.cs` with real-time progress.
  - Capture `StandardError` stream during FFmpeg analysis
  - Parse `time=` output to calculate percentage
  - Fire `TrackProgressChangedEvent` for Downloads Page progress bar

#### UX Polish & Reliability (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Downloads Page Hydration**: Fix "Empty Downloads Page" bug.
  - On `DownloadCenterViewModel.Initialize()`, query database for current state:
    ```csharp
    ActiveDownloads = _db.Tracks.Where(t => t.State == Downloading).ToList();
    ```
  - Ensures UI reflects DB state, not just live events
- [ ] **Deterministic Track ID**: Implement hash-based deduplication.
  - Generate `TrackEntity.Id` using hash of ISRC (if available) or `artist-title` lowercase string
  - Prevents duplicate downloads across multiple playlist jobs
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker UI Indicator**: Add `_isSpotifyServiceDegraded` flag.
  - Set flag on 403 errors instead of just breaking loop
  - Bind "Warning Icon" in header to show "Spotify Sync Unavailable" status
  - User feedback instead of silent failures

  - User feedback instead of silent failures

### 🎯 UI Placeholder Refactor (The "Transparency" Phase) - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
**Goal**: Eliminate "dead clicks" and connect backend logic to frontend placeholders.

#### 1. Track Inspector "Phantom" Data
- [ ] Update `TrackInspectorView` to hide empty "Energy/Danceability" fields if data missing.
- [ ] Add "Fetch Intelligence" button if fields are empty.
- [ ] Bind `AudioAnalysis` properties correctly.

#### 2. Home Page Bento Grid
- [x] Hook "Library Health" card to `CrashRecoveryJournal` queries.
- [x] Show "Active Recoveries" count if startup recovery ran.

  - Allows retrying stuck items after user fixes disk issues.

#### 3. USB Export & Player Control
- [x] Set `IsEnabled="False"` on "Upgrade Scout" and "Sonic Integrity" (Placeholder UI Hardening).
- [ ] Disable Pitch Slider until `AudioPlayerService` supports stretching.
- [ ] **Rekordbox Stubbing**: Background task to pre-calculate XML structure for Gold Status tracks.
- [ ] Implement "Export to Rekordbox" UI (currently missing) before disabling it.

### 🏗️ Architectural Improvements & Advanced Features

#### Download Stability (HIGH Priority)
- [ ] **Stalled Download Fix**: Improve `SoulseekAdapter.cs` timeout logic.
  - Distinguish between `TransferStates.Queued` and `InProgress`
  - Disable 60-second timeout while `Queued` (can last hours on Soulseek)
  - Only start stall timer once state shifts to `InProgress`
  - Prevents premature download cancellation

#### Intelligence & Scoring (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Uploader Trust Scoring**: Add `QueueLength` and `HasFreeUploadSlot` to `ScoringWeights.cs`.
  - Rank 256kbps with open slot higher than 320kbps with 50-person queue
  - Optimize for "Time-to-Listen" vs absolute fidelity
  - Captures data already available in `ParseTrackFromFile()`
- [ ] **VBR Fraud Detection**: Extend `SonicIntegrityService` to detect upscaled files.
  - Check frequency cutoff (< 16kHz indicates upscaled 128kbps→FLAC)
  - Add `FidelityStatus` field: `Genuine | Upscaled | Suspicious`
  - Visual indicator in UI for low-quality masquerading files
- [ ] **Metadata Confidence Score**: Store `ConfidenceScore` (0.0-1.0) in `TrackEntity`.

- [ ] **The Brain 2.0: Adaptive Intelligence**:
  - [ ] **Fuzzy Normalization**: Refactor `CalculateSimilarity` to handle Unicode dashes, curly quotes, and "feat." vs "ft." normalization.
  - [ ] **Relaxation Strategy**: Implement a "Match Relaxation" timer in `DownloadManager`. If no match found after 30s, retry with ±15s tolerance and lower bitrate threshold.
  - [ ] **User Trust & Availability**: Factor in `QueueLength` vs `Bitrate` trade-offs (Aggressive "interference" fix).
  - [ ] **BPM Intelligence**: Add `DjMode` toggle that forces search for "BPM" keywords in filename.
  - [ ] **Quality Hard-Gating**: Default ranking to "High Fidelty" (FLAC Preferred, 320kbps MP3 Floor).

#### Library UI & UX (HIGH Priority)
- [ ] **Draggable Column Reordering**: Implement drag-to-reorder for TreeDataGrid columns.
  - Allow users to prioritize Status, BPM, or other columns first
  - Persist column order to user preferences
  - Improve visual hierarchy and customization
- [ ] **Scoped Album Card ViewModels**: Refactor Bento Grid for performance.
  - Each `AlbumCard` gets its own scoped ViewModel
  - Handles own `DownloadCommand` instead of binding to central command
  - Prevents UI lag with 100+ albums updating simultaneously
- [ ] **Skeleton Screens**: Add loading placeholders during API/search latency.
  - Semi-transparent "ghost rows" during Spotify/Soulseek searches
  - Makes app feel 2x faster with perceived performance boost

#### Advanced Features (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] **Self-Healing Upgrade Scout**: Background worker to find better quality versions.
  - Scans library for tracks < 192kbps
  - Automatically initiates Soulseek search for 320kbps/FLAC upgrade
  - User approval required before replacing files

## Phase 2.5: Download Orchestration & Active Management (10-12 hours) 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

**Goal**: Transform download system from "Import → Fire-and-Forget" to "Active Orchestration" with concurrency control, resumability, and real-time visibility.

### 2.5.1 Orchestration Engine: Throttling & Queuing (3 hours)
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL

**What to Build**:
- [ ] `SemaphoreSlim(4, 4)` throttling in `DownloadManager` to limit concurrent downloads to 4
- [ ] `ProcessQueueLoop` with fire-and-forget pattern for continuous queue processing
- [ ] Folder creation logic: `DefaultLibraryPath/ArtistName/AlbumName/` before first track starts
- [ ] `.part` file handling for resumable downloads (download to `.tmp` → rename on completion)
- [ ] File size verification for resume support (check existing `.part` file size)

**Concurrency Strategy**:
```csharp
private readonly SemaphoreSlim _downloadSemaphore = new(4, 4);

public async Task ProcessQueueLoop(CancellationToken ct)
{
    while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        // 1. Wait for a track to be available in the ConcurrentQueue
        if (_downloadQueue.TryDequeue(out var ctx))
        {
            // 2. Wait for one of the 4 slots to open up
            await _downloadSemaphore.WaitAsync(ct);

            // 3. Fire and forget the download task so the loop can pick up the next track
            _ = Task.Run(async () => 
            {
                try 
                {
                    await ProcessTrackWithFolderLogicAsync(ctx);
                }
                finally 
                {
                    _downloadSemaphore.Release(); // Free up the slot for the next track
                }
            }, ct);
        }
        else
        {
            await Task.Delay(500, ct); // Idle wait

- [ ] Hash verification for partial files (optional: skip if protocol doesn't support)
- [ ] Atomic rename on completion: `TrackName.mp3.part` → `TrackName.mp3`
- [ ] Database state: persist `Paused` state to DB on app close
- [ ] Auto-resume: on app restart, scan DB for `Paused`/`Pending` tracks and re-enqueue

**Resumability Logic**:
```csharp
private async Task DownloadFileAsync(PlaylistTrack track, string targetPath)
{
    var partPath = targetPath + ".part";
    long startPosition = 0;
    
    // Check if partial file exists
    if (File.Exists(partPath))
    {
        var fileInfo = new FileInfo(partPath);
        startPosition = fileInfo.Length;
        _logger.LogInformation($"Resuming download from byte {startPosition}");
    }
    
    // Download with resume support
    // (Implementation depends on Soulseek API support for partial transfers)
    await DownloadFromPositionAsync(track, partPath, startPosition);
    
    // Atomic rename on success
    File.Move(partPath, targetPath, overwrite: false);
}
```

## 🚫 Deferred Features (Post-v1.0 Stabilization)

> [!CAUTION]
> **8-Week Feature Freeze**: The following features are valuable but DEFERRED until after v1.0 stabilization is complete. Focus on reliability and speed first.

### Deferred UX Enhancements
- **Draggable Column Reordering** (TODO line 278-281) - User customization, but not critical
- **Download Timeline Visualization** - Nice-to-have transparency feature
- **Scoring Sandbox** (Dev Tool) - Power user feature, low priority

### Deferred Search Features
- **Advanced Filtering HUD** - Bitrate sliders, format chips, user trust toggle
- **Batch Actions & Selection** - Multi-select download/add to playlist
- **Overlay Bug Fix** - Non-blocking if no user reports

### Deferred Advanced Features
- **Self-Healing Upgrade Scout UI** - Backend exists, defer UI polish
- **DJ-Focused Visuals** - Camelot wheel, waveform preview
- **Rekordbox/Denon USB Export** - Workflow integration, not core functionality

**Rationale**: These features require significant development time but don't impact core reliability. Early adopters must experience a bug-free, fast app before we add complexity.

**Re-evaluation Date**: After 8-week stabilization period (February 2026)
